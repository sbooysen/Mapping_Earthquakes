# Mapping_Earthquakes
## By: Stacey Booysen

For this project, we helped to create a map that showed recent earthquakes for the past 7 days across the world. We added the ability to choose from three different map styles, the ability to show or hide the earthquake spots, and the ability to show the highest magnitude earthquakes above the rest. We also added a fault line option and pop-ups to show location and magnitude.
